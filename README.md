Fruit Finder - identify apples, oranges, and bananas in given images using HSV color thresholds

Sunset Detector - identify sunsets using SVMs and neural nets using 294 feature vector found by splitting image into 49 7x7 grids and finding the mean and standard deviation of L, S, and T in the LST color space for each grid.
